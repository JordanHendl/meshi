# [MESHI]

Meshi is my 'engine' project. 

# [Design Goals]
* Rust Backend (Audio, Graphics, IO, etc) + C++ Frontend for game scripting & object management
* GPU Driven Rendering
* Simplified Component System

# [TODOs]
* Lighting Modes (PBR, Toon, ETC)
* Better user input controls/wrappers
* Audio
* Animations

# [ Notice ]
* This is mostly for me learning, and to (hopefully) make games in later.
